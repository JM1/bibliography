 abstract  = {Generic programming depends on the decomposition of programs into components which may be developed separately and combined arbitrarily, subject only to well-defined interfaces. Among the interfaces of interest, indeed the most pervasively and unconsciously used, are the fundamental operators common to all C++ built-in types, as extended to user-defined types; e.g., copy constructors, assignment, and equality. We investigate the relations which must hold among these operators to preserve consistency with their semantics for the built-in types and with the expectations of programmers. We can produce an axiomatization of these operators which yields the required consistency with built-in types, matches the intuitive expectations of programmers, and also reflects our underlying mathematical expectations.},

A widely employed style of programming, particularly in structure-processing languages which impose no discipline of types, entails defining procedures which work well on objects of a wide variety.

 abstract = {Generic programming aims to increase the flexibility of programming languages, by expanding the possibilities for parametrizationÂ --- ideally, without also expanding the possibilities for uncaught errors. The term means different things to different people: parametric polymorphism, data abstraction, meta-programming, and so on. We use it to mean polytypism, that is, parametrization by the shape of data structures rather than their contents. To avoid confusion with other uses, we have coined the qualified term datatype-generic programming for this purpose. In these lecture notes, we expand on the definition of datatype-generic programming, and present some examples of datatype-generic programs. We also explore the connection with design patterns in object-oriented programming; in particular, we argue that certain design patterns are just higher-order datatype-generic programs.},

In our view general-purpose languages are not yet general-purpose enough, and progress needs to be made before we can provide domain-specific languages that are both fast and safe. We outline some goals in this regard, and describe a possible implementation technology: guaranteed optimization, a technique for building compilers that provide proven guarantees of what optimizations they perform. Such optimizers can provide capabilities similar to staged languages, and thus provide the relevant performance improvements. They can also function as decision procedures, suggesting an approach of `optimizers as theorem provers,' in which optimizing compilers can be used to check domain-specific safety properties and check proofs embedded in programs.},

 abstract = {In this chapter, we present a generic programming methodology for expressing data structures and algorithms for numerical linear algebra. We also present a high-performance implementation of this approach, the Matrix Template Library (MTL). As with the Standard Template Library, our approach is five-fold, consisting of generic functions, containers, iterators, adapters, and function objects, all developed specifically for high-performance numerical linear algebra. Within our framework, we provide generic functions corresponding to the mathematical operations that define linear algebra. Similarly, the containers, adapters, and iterators are used to represent and to manipulate concrete linear algebra objects such as matrices and vectors. To many scientific computing users, however, the advantages of an elegant programming interface are secondary to issues of performance. There are two aspects to how we achieved high performance in the MTL. The first is the use of static polymorphism (template functions) with modern optimizing compilers, enabling extreme flexibility with no loss in performance. The second is the application of abstraction to the optimization process itself. The Basic Linear Algebra Instruction Set (BLAIS) is presented as an abstract interface to several important performance optimizations. Our experimental results show that MTL with the BLAIS achieves performance that is as good as, or better than, vendor-tuned libraries, even though MTL and the BLAIS are written completely in C++. We therefore conclude that the use of abstraction is not a barrier to performance, contrary to conventional wisdom, and that certain abstractions can in fact facilitate optimization. In addition, MTL requires orders of magnitude fewer lines of code for its implementation, with the concomitant savings in development and maintenance effort.},

 location = {Erfurt, Germany},
 url = {http://oonumerics.org/tmpw00/},
 abstract = {Generic programming in C++ is characterized by the use of template parameters to represent abstract data types (or ``concepts''). However, the C++ language itself does not provide a mechanism for explicitly handling concepts. As a result, it can be difficult to insure that a concrete type meets the requirements of the concept it is supposed to represent. Error messages resulting from incorrect use of a concrete type can be particularly difficult to decipher. In this paper we present techniques to check parameters in generic C++ libraries. Our techniques use standard C++ and introduce no run-time overhead.},

 abstract = {We define a mapping from generic Haskell specifications to C++ with concepts, a recent extension to C++, that can ultimately be automated. More specifically, we provide a translation from Haskell multi-parameter type classes with functional dependencies to ConceptC++. Our translation consists of three major parts: the division of Haskell class variables into ConceptC++ concept parameters and associated types, the corresponding division of superclasses in the context of a type class, and the linearization of Haskell ASTs to the concrete syntax of ConceptC++. We also discuss cases in which there is no single correct translation from classes with functional dependencies to concepts. Our translation handles these cases in a reasonable way and is well-defined for the cases most common in practice. The translation is motivated by an ongoing project for distributed adaptive finite volume methods, in which software components are modeled in Haskell and implemented in C++. },

This review discusses a range of techniques for analyzing such data, with the aim of extracting simplified models that capture the essential features of these flows, in order to gain insight into the flow physics, and potentially identify mechanisms for controlling these flows. We review well-developed techniques, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and Galerkin projection, and discuss more recent techniques developed for linear systems, such as balanced truncation and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). We then discuss some of the methods available for nonlinear systems, with particular attention to the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional linear operator that completely characterizes the dynamics of a nonlinear system and provides an extension of DMD to nonlinear systems.},

All these methods decompose possibly nonlinear and/or nonstationary time series data into a finite amount of components separated by instantaneous frequencies. This decomposition provides a powerful method to look into the different processes behind a given time series data, and provides a way to separate short time-scale events from a general trend. We present a free software implementation of EMD, EEMD and CEEMDAN and give an overview of the EMD methodology and the algorithms used in the decomposition. We release our implementation, libeemd, with the aim of providing a user-friendly, fast, stable, well-documented and easily extensible EEMD library for anyone interested in using (E)EMD in the analysis of time series data. While written in C for numerical efficiency, our implementation includes interfaces to the Python and R languages, and interfaces to other languages are straightforward.},

 abstract = {Generic programming is an especially attractive paradigm for developing libraries for high-performance computing because it simultaneously emphasizes generality and efficiency. In the generic programming approach, interfaces are based on sets of specified requirements on types, rather than on any particular types, allowing algorithms to inter-operate with any data types meeting the necessary requirements. These sets of requirements, known as concepts, can specify syntactic as well as semantic requirements. Besides providing a powerful means of describing interfaces to maximize software reuse, concepts provide a uniform mechanism for more closely coupling libraries with compilers and for effecting domain-specific library-based compiler extensions. To realize this goal however, programming languages and their associated tools must support concepts as first-class constructs. In this paper we advocate better syntactic and semantic support to make concepts first-class and present results demonstrating the kinds of improvements that are possible with static checking, compiler optimization, and algorithm correctness proofs for generic libraries based on concepts.},

This is despite the remarkable fraction of syntax and semantics usually shared between successive cycles. In this paper, we present a component-based approach to avoid reimplementation of shared PL fractions. We provide two sets of reusable components; one for syntax implementation and another for semantics. Our syntax and semantics components correspond to syntactic categories and semantics rules of a PL specification, respectively. We show how, in addition to their service to reusability in syntax and semantics, our components can cater reusable implementation of PL analyses.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a method for developing generic C++ software libraries from functional prototypes, based on program transformation. More precisely, the type signatures of generic functions, i.e., functions parameterized on types, are transformed. This transformation maps type-level expressions from functional higher-order, typed languages to type-level expressions in C++. In particular, type-level functional constructs such as higher-order functions and type constructors, are mapped to type parameters of generics that are constrained with appropriate concepts. The core of the transformation is a novel form of ``defunctionalization'' at the level of types. To make the transformation retargetable, we based it on two kernel languages that can be bound to different functional and object-oriented languages. For this paper, we use bindings to Haskell as front end and C++ with concepts as back end. Our transformational approach presents an alternative to a language extension and is useful particularly for functional prototyping where functional features are employed at specification time. We illustrate our approach by a case study: we show how we developed a generic C++ library for vulnerability modeling in the context of global change from a functional prototype in Haskell.},

 abstract = {This chapter gives an introduction to a number of computational techniques that are used in the study of train aerodynamics. Firstly, the range of analytical and numerical techniques used in train aerodynamics is described. Simple panel methods are then outlined and their historic and continuing utility discussed. The use of the Reynolds-averaged NavierâStokes (RANS) equations is then discussed at some length. The representation of turbulence in this approach is presented, and a range of turbulence viscosity models are discussed. Reynolds stress models and unsteady RANS methods are briefly described. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the NavierâStokes equations is then considered, and it is shown that a direct application of this approach to train aerodynamics is not currently possible. Hybrid models are then discussed (large eddy simulation (LES) and detached eddy simulation (DES), which use DNS for the calculation of large turbulence scales and turbulence models of different sorts for small turbulence scales or near flow boundaries. The Lattice Boltzmann (LB) approach is then set out, which solves the Boltzmann equation rather than the NavierâStokes equations, and is used in a similar manner to LES. Finally, a range of numerical optimisation techniques are presented.},

These guidelines provided though by no means exhaustive will allow the reader in an advantageous position to understand how an appropriate CFD solution can be attained that is physically valid and meaningful through the above guidelines. It is shown that CFD simulation and analysis are more than a mechanically driven oriented exercise. They usually encapsulate an understanding of the application of the essential fundamental theory of conservation equations and numerical methods to solve the CFD problem and an appreciation of setting a viable mesh, defining suitable boundary conditions and models to arrive at a proper CFD solution.},

 abstract = {In computational fluid dynamics simulations of industrial flows, models based on the Reynolds-averaged NavierâStokes (RANS) equations are expected to play an important role in decades to come. However, model uncertainties are still a major obstacle for the predictive capability of RANS simulations. This review examines both the parametric and structural uncertainties in turbulence models. We review recent literature on data-free (uncertainty propagation) and data-driven (statistical inference) approaches for quantifying and reducing model uncertainties in RANS simulations. Moreover, the fundamentals of uncertainty propagation and Bayesian inference are introduced in the context of RANS model uncertainty quantification. Finally, the literature on uncertainties in scale-resolving simulations is briefly reviewed with particular emphasis on large eddy simulations.}

 abstract = {Turbulence is an enigmatic state of fluid flow that includes unpredictable fluctuations even when the flowâs boundary conditions are steady and smooth. These fluctuations typically occur over a wide range of length and time scales. For analysis, a turbulent flow is decomposed into average (or mean) and fluctuating fields. The field equations governing the average flow field contain derivatives of the correlation tensor of the fluctuating flow field, and therefore do not represent a closed system of equations. However, when the turbulence is homogeneous and isotropic some relationships between the average and fluctuating flow fields can be deduced. In particular, the kinetic energy that sustains the turbulence is extracted from the average flow and is eventually dissipated by the viscous motions of the smallest turbulent fluctuations. Spectral measurements from a variety of turbulent flows suggest this process is universal. Scaling laws for turbulent shear flows that develop near or away from solid boundaries can be deduced from dimensional analysis, similarity analyses, and geometric considerations. Turbulent mean-flow predictions commonly rely on approximate models that close the system of average-flow equations. Turbulence may be modified in stratified media like the earth's ocean and atmosphere.}

In three spatial dimensions, scalars (like density) can be described by a single number; vectors (like velocity) can be described by three components, one for each orthogonal spatial direction; and second-order tensors (like stress) can be described by nine components, one for each pair of spatial directions. Although the meanings of vectors and second-order tensors that represent physical quantities are independent of the orientation of the coordinate system in which they are resolved, their components do change when coordinate axes are rotated. The equations for fluid motion include a variety of algebraic and differential relationships involving scalars, vectors, and second-order tensors. Index notation is the preferred means for specifying these relationships and operations, especially when the gradient operator (vector derivative) is involved. In addition, integrals of flow-field quantities along curves, on surfaces, and within volumes in two and three dimensions must follow certain relationships.}
